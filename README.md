# Rtos++
This is a rtos for avr. I only test it on ATmega328.

The OS only contains a kernel at this moment, which means there is only a schduler in it.

A example can be found in [test/](test/).

# Acknowledgement
I learned much from a blog whose author is Jianchang Huang. But now this blog is not avaiable on the Internet. Anyone who need it just email [me(This address only just for it)](mailto:chinatianma+Jianchang@gmail.com), I have a pdf file which is written in Chinese.
